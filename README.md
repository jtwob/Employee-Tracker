## Description
This is an employee database that runs in the console. It can add a new department of operations, a new role in that department, or a new employee to any of these roles. Employees can be designated managers as needed. In addition, view all options exist for departments, roles, and employees. If an employee takes on a new position, an update role menu item is available. Similarly if an employee is assigned a new manager, an update manager option is also available.
